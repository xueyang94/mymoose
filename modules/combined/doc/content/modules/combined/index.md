# Combined Module

As its name implies, the Combined module combines the capabilities of all of the
other modules. This module does not provide capabilities on its own. Its main
purpose is to provide an executable that links together the capabilites of other
modules to allow them to be coupled together for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Coupled physics tutorials

A set of [tutorial problems](combined/tutorials/introduction/index.md) that show how
capabilities from the other physics modules can be used together make use of the
combined module.
