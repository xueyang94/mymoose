# INL HPC Cluster

This page aims at simplifying the installation process on INL computing clusters.
The [general cluster instructions](hpc_install_moose.md) may also be used, but these
instructions will save some steps. There are multiple options for installing / using
MOOSE and MOOSE applications.

!alert note
Falcon is planned to be decommissioned March 31 2022.

!alert warning
Do not mix installation workflows. Do not install `libMesh` or `PETSc` directly unless
you know what you are doing.

## Option 1: Loading an application directly (easy, users only)

You may load pre-built binaries for MOOSE
and the applications you have access to by running: `module load use.moose moose-apps <app_name>`.
Pre-built executables are then added in the `PATH` environment variable, and can be called
directly in any folder with: `app_name-opt -i <input_file>`. This is not really an installation per-say,
we just want to make you aware of this option.

!alert note
Pre-built binaries are only available after access has been requested for the relevant applications through the
[NCRC](ncrc/ncrc_ondemand.md).

## Option 2: Modules + source-based installation (medium, for developers)

!alert warning
When installing with Option 2, the installed MOOSE or application will only
function on **one** of the INL clusters. The compilers/MPI distributions are not the same
on all the platforms.

!alert warning
If any of the modules (mostly the specific version) you used when installing is no longer offered, you will need to
install again. We take every achievable step to avoid this, but it is at times unavoidable on this shared infrastructure.

### Step 0: download MOOSE and the application you need

MOOSE may be classically obtained from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/idaholab/moose).
Many open-source MOOSE applications may also be obtained from GitHub, while others will require
officially requesting source code access through the [NCRC](ncrc/ncrc_ondemand.md).

MOOSE and the application you want should be installed on the scratch storage space. This file system
is much faster than the file system that hosts your home directory. For example to download MOOSE:

```
  cd /scratch/$USER
  mkdir projects
  cd projects
  git clone git@github.com:idaholab/moose.git
```

### Step 1: load some compilers

In order to compile MOOSE and its applications, we first need to load compilers & compiling tools.
The following modules are recommended for each of INL's clusters:

- Falcon: `module load use.moose MVAPICH2 CMake`

- Lemhi: `module load use.moose moose-dev`

- Sawtooth: `module load use.moose moose-dev`


!alert note
If you use HPC modules, you will need to load them every time you log in! One solution is to
modify/create the `.bash_profile` file and add these `module load` commands there. However, be careful
that this is not always harmless to other HPC programs, and can interfere with other modules
you would be using on INL HPC.

### Step 2: download MOOSE dependencies

MOOSE dependencies, mainly PETSc and libMesh, may be obtained using the `update_and_rebuild_...`
scripts, as is detailed in these [instructions](hpc_install_moose.md). These scripts currently
should be run on the head node, as the compute nodes do not have access to the internet.
Please make sure to `export MOOSE_JOBS=6` to control the number of cores used for installation.

!alert note
If using [INL HPC OnDemand](gen_ondemand.md), you will have to use a `login` session for
this step, and will only have access to a single core, so `MOOSE_JOBS` should be 1. Compute
nodes (`Compute CPU`) cannot perform this step as it requires more direct access to internet.

```
  cd /scratch/$USER/projects/moose/scripts
  export MOOSE_JOBS=6
  ./update_and_rebuild_petsc.sh
  ./update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh
```

### Step 3: Build MOOSE and the app

This should be as simple as going into the app directory and building using the Makefile.
For example for MOOSE, we build the test executable as shown below

```
  cd /scratch/$USER/projects/moose/test
  make -j6
```

## Option 3: conda (mamba) installation (not recommended, light users)

!alert warning
The [conda/mamba-based installation](conda.md) is not recommended for INL HPC, as it does not use
optimized, architecture-specific compilers. However, if you are not seeking performance,
and will not use more than one node (to limit the attrition of computational resources),
you are free to use them.

!alert note
If you want to use MPI with a conda installation, you will likely need to use the `mpiexec / mpirun`
in the conda package, not another one from a module.

!alert note
Do not use the `miniconda/anaconda` HPC module. Download and install your own conda. If you get permission
errors when trying to install conda packages, it is likely the HPC conda module is being used.
`module unload miniconda` should be ran to remove it.

!alert warning
The `conda` installation modifies the `.bashrc` file in a manner that is currently incompatible with
the use of [HPC OnDemand](gen_ondemand.md). If you experience issues logging in that service, try
commenting out the `conda` modifications to the `.bashrc` file.
