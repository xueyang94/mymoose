# Examples and Tutorials

This page includes various demonstrations intended to introduce the basics of [!ac](MOOSE) for creating custom applications to solve unique and challenging multiphysics problems. Each example or tutorial focuses on different aspects of MOOSE, primarily the fundamental systems that are available to solve multiphysics problems.

Before proceeding, please visit the [installation/index.md] page and the [getting_started/new_users.md] page. It is assumed that the reader has a minimial understanding in computer programming with [C++](#programming).

## Examples

The [!ac](MOOSE) repository has a directory named `examples` with several subdirectories. Each subdirectory
has code for a MOOSE-based application and input file(s) for running simulations. Each example can
be used by running a binary that is first compiled by running `make` in the applicable subdirectory.
The resulting application binary (named e.g. `ex01-opt`) is used to run input
files.  A guide explaining what each example
demonstrates and how to use it is provided here:

## Tutorials

!alert tip prefix=False title=[tutorial01_app_development/index.md]
[tutorial01_app_development/index.md]\\
Learn how to develop a MOOSE-based application to solve coupled systems of differential equations in a multiphysics setting. This tutorial teaches you how to create custom MOOSE objects, setup input files to invoke these objects, and how to process and visualize the results of your simulations.

!alert tip prefix=False title=[tutorial02_multiapps/index.md]
[tutorial02_multiapps/index.md]\\
Learn how to use the [Multiapp](MultiApps/index.md) and [Transfer](Transfers/index.md) systems to couple many multiphysics applications together across differing time or length scales.

!alert tip prefix=False title=[tutorial03_verification/index.md]
[tutorial03_verification/index.md]\\
Demonstrate the use of analytical solutions and the [!ac](MMS) for code verification.

!alert tip prefix=False title=Porous Flow Tutorial
[Porous Flow Tutorial](modules/porous_flow/tutorial_00.md)\\
This tutorial guides the user through some commonly-used aspects of the [Porous Flow](modules/porous_flow/index.md) module. It concerns fluid injection through a borehole into a large fluid-filled reservoir. The tutorial begins with simple Darcy flow, and gradually adds more complex phenomena such as coupling with heat and solid mechanics, multi-phase flows and chemical reactions.

## Workshops id=workshop

The [!ac](MOOSE) development team at [!ac](INL) occasionally hosts live training. Registration is typically open for all who wish to attend, although space is usually limited. Below are links to the training presentation, a recent video recording of the training, and other targeted more advanced workshop presentations.

- [MOOSE Training Workshop](workshop/index.md alternative=missing_config.md)
- [MOOSE Training Workshop (Summer 2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tJwBsYaLaI)
- [MOOSE MultiApps Workshop](tutorial02_multiapps/presentation/index.md alternative=missing_config.md)
- [MOOSE Verification Workshop](tutorial03_verification/presentation/index.md alternative=missing_config.md)

MOOSE training events will typically be announced on the [home page](index.md exact=true), but be sure to join the [mailing list](help/contact_us.md) for further updates!
