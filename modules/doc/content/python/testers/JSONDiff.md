# JSONDiff

`JSONDiff` tests compare `JSON` output(s) for the test to a reference in the specified
`gold_dir` folder. `JSON` output is generated by certain user objects, by the mesh, and by reporters (for example,
the `PerfGraphReporter` or the `MeshInfo` reporter).

## Options

Test configuration options are added to the `tests` file.

- `jsondiff`: A list of `JSON` files to compare

- `skip_keys`: A list of keys to skip in the `JSON` comparison


Other test commands & restrictions may be found in the [TestHarness documentation](TestHarness.md).

## Example test configuration in the MOOSE test suite

In this example, the mesh output by a [RenameBlockGenerator.md] is being checked using a
`MeshInfo` reporter, which outputs a `JSON` file. This `JSON` file is compared to a reference to
make sure the mesh block names are properly changed.
