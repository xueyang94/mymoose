# Exodiff

`Exodiff` tests compare `Exodus` output(s) for the test to a reference in the specified
`gold_dir` folder. `Exodus` output(s) contains both field variables, scalar variables and postprocessors,
the latter two defined as global variables. This tester picks up any difference between
all fields at any spatial location, at any time step included in the output(s).
Complete documentation for the `Exodiff` utility may be found [here](https://gsjaardema.github.io/seacas-docs/sphinx/html/index.html#exodiff).

## Options

Test configuration options are added to the `tests` file.

- `abs_tol`: sets an absolute tolerance, defaults to 1e-10. Both absolute and relative tolerances must
  be met for a test to pass.

- `rel_tol`: sets a relative tolerance. Defaults to 5.5e-6.

- `exodiff_opts`: additional options passed to the `Exodiff` utility on the command line. Their list
  may be found in its [documentation](https://gsjaardema.github.io/seacas-docs/sphinx/html/index.html#exodiff)

- `custom_cmp`: use a custom comparison. The output of the comparison
  must match the specified file. See [below](#custom_cmp) for more details

- `map`: use geometrical mapping to match up elements. This is usually a good idea because it makes files comparable between runs with Serial and Parallel Mesh. Defaults to True.

- `partial`: invokes a matching algorithm similar to the `-m` option when running `exodiff` on the command line.
             However this option ignores unmatched nodes and elements.  This allows
             comparison of files that only partially overlap. Defaults to False.

- `use_old_floor`: Use `Exodiff` old floor option. Defaults to False


Other test commands & restrictions may be found in the [TestHarness documentation](TestHarness.md).

## Generating custom comparison files id=custom_cmp

A custom comparison file may be generated by running in the command line:

```
${MOOSE_DIR}/framework/contrib/exodiff/exodiff -summary moose_simulation_out.e
```

This generates a summary of the simulation which can be edited to make the
custom comparison file, where the tolerances for each variable may be set individually.
In the example shown below, the relative tolerance criterion for the `z_field` variable
is modified from the global value of `5.5e-6` to `10`. This essentially disables
comparison for that field.

In this example, the global absolute tolerance for all variables is being modified
from its default of `1e-11` to `10`. This essentially disables comparison for all variables,
but lower values (`1e-8` is common) may be useful to loosen tolerances in a test.

A field may be ignored by either setting a loose tolerance, or if it may be present
in only one of the files by deleting the line for the field in the comparison file.

## Example test configuration in the MOOSE test suite

In this example, four tests are set up using an `Exodiff` tester. The third one uses the same input file
as the second one, with additional arguments passed on the command line to run a different configuration.
The `Exodus` files compared here mainly contain the values of the array variables on the mesh.
