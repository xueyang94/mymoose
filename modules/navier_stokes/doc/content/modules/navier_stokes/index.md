# Navier-Stokes Module

The MOOSE Navier-Stokes module is a library for the implementation of simulation tools that solve the
Navier-Stokes equations using either the continuous Galerkin finite element
(CGFE) or finite volume (FV) methods. The Navier-Stokes
equations are usually solved using either the pressure-based, incompressible formulation (assuming a
constant fluid density), or a density-based, compressible formulation, although
there are plans to add a finite volume weakly-compressible pressured-based implementation in
the not-too-distant future.

For documentation specific to finite element or finite volume implementations,
please refer to the below pages:

Here we give a brief tabular summary of the Navier-Stokes implementations:

Table definitions:

- AD: automatic differentiation
- SUPG: Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin
- RC: Rhie-Chow interpolation
- CD: central differencing interpolation; equivalent to average interpolation
- HLLC: Harten Lax van Leer Contact
- data: includes both the advector, velocity, and the advected quantities
- limited: different limiters can be applied when interpolating cell-centered
  data to faces. A summary of limiter options can be found in
  [Limiters/index.md]
