# SideValueSampler

!syntax description /VectorPostprocessors/SideValueSampler

The data output to CSV is output with the following columns:

- the id of the element the quadrature point, on the side, belongs to

- the values of the requested variables

- the X, Y, Z coordinates of the quadrature points on the side


!alert note
When this VectorPostprocessor is executed on an internal boundary, the nodes are shared by more than one element, which each have a quadrature point on them. A value is output for every quadrature point.

## Example input syntax

In this example, variable `u` and `v` are the solutions of two boundary value diffusion problems. Their value along the `top` boundary and along the `center` internal sidesets are reported using two `SideValueSampler`. The rows in the CSV output are sorted according the `x` coordinate along the boundary for the former, and the element `id` for the latter.
